# English-explanation-of-thesis-paper
This is an explaination in english of my thesis, titled Design and implementation based on the LEAIoT cryptographic algorithm, for Internet of things (IoT) applications which was originaly writen in greek.
The original text and the VHDL description that acompanies it can be found in https://nemertes.library.upatras.gr/jspui/handle/10889/14717.
This does NOT intend to be a full translation of the original text, but to explain the design of the
implemented circuit and the reasoning behind it.
